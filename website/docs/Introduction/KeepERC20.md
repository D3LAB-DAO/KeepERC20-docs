# KeepERC20

To provide security and convenience without compromising decentralization, we propose KeepERC20, a distributed bank-and-wallet based on smart contracts and Chainlink Automation.

Currently, KeepERC20 offers three functions:
- Scheduled Transfer
- Recoverable Transfer
- Expirable Approve

We will continuously add more convenient and secure functions.
